            Abstract—Everyone has a role to play in cybersecurity and cyber risk
            management, but people without security backgrounds seldom
            understand—let alone accept or endorse—such roles. Public and
            private organizations face common challenges in facilitating more
            secure behaviors among employees. As part of their missions, most
            colleges and universities in the United States have general
            education programs that aim to instill certain competencies and
            characteristics in all graduates (for individual and greater good).
            This paper proposes that a cybersecurity general education course
            could help improve common workplace challenges in cybersecurity
            training and awareness, and that such a course could align with each
            institution’s general education goals to benefit not only graduates
            but also communities and society writ large. Keywords—cybersecurity
            education, risk management, general education, information security,
            computer security I. INTRODUCTION A successful cybersecurity posture
            means that an organization (a) is confident in its understanding of
            its cyber risks and (b) is comfortable with its current allocation
            of risk decisions related to protection/mitigation and incident
            response activities throughout the enterprise. Maintaining that
            successful posture requires regular re-evaluation of both (a) and
            (b) conditions, especially as internal and external changes occur.

            organization — i.e., the awareness and skills that end users learn
            in one organization can carry over into other realms such as their
            families, social/civic communities, and future employment
            organizations. This continuum of the shared benefits of
            cybersecurity training aligns with some of the rationales and
            purposes for general education in colleges and universities:
            generating improvements not only for individuals but also for a
            greater good. As discussed in this paper, the commonalities within
            enduser cybersecurity training and awareness needs, and the benefits
            sympathetic to general education goals (individual, societal, and
            market based), combine to present a solid argument in favor of
            including cybersecurity in general education. Section II discusses
            fundamentals of cybersecurity knowledge and behaviors needed in all
            kinds of organizations. Section III presents a brief review of
            postsecondary general education concepts in the United States and a
            summary of prior literature on cybersecurity for general education.
            Section IV analyzes how a general education course for cybersecurity
            could help meet organizational and societal needs while also
            fulfilling some of the common expectations and purposes for general
            education. Section V

            The importance of employees’ cybersecurity capabilities and behavior
            has been amplified by the growing integration of remote work
            structures and the increased use of personal devices and smart
            devices throughout organizations. In two large surveys [7], [8], 52%
            to 56% of respondents identified human error by their employees as
            the largest cybersecurity vulnerability for their organizations.
            Lessening the likelihood of errors, and mitigating the impacts when
            problems occur, are two of the goals of cybersecurity training and
            awareness programs. However, while organizations recognize the need
            to educate and raise cybersecurity awareness in their employees,
            research shows that their training/awareness programs can still
            struggle to effect the behavior change needed to sustain or improve
            the organization’s cybersecurity posture [8], [9]. In a 2022 study
            [9], the largest challenges were: employees’ lack of acceptance of
            the need for cybersecurity training, misunderstanding of the
            concepts, and a low motivation to participate. traditional liberal
            education or professionally targeted

            preparations for entering the workforce or a blend of both; and, as
            detailed more fully in [14], institutions may reconsider and
            reformulate their general education approaches as societies evolve
            and internal and external pressures come into play. A full
            discussion of the social, political, and economic pressures in the
            history and current context of U.S. general education is beyond this
            paper, but [14] – [18] provide a solid overview. The purpose of this
            section is to summarize the goals and nature of post-secondary
            general education, laying a foundation for considering the inclusion
            of cybersecurity in such programs. General education often
            encourages exploration into broader contexts of a situation or
            discipline. It helps to develop skills for extrapolating beyond
            one’s own experience/understanding and for spotting and raising
            questions that can facilitate new or better knowledge. And it
            exposes students to the processes required to participate and
            collaborate in solving complex problems. General education also
            typically cultivates the common knowledge and capabilities necessary
            to communicate and engage as citizens and members of a community.

            B. Cybersecurity within General Education While a good deal of
            literature has addressed improvements in education for
            cybersecurity-related disciplines and majors, e.g., [21] – [26],
            several scholars have provided argumentation and case studies
            supporting the addition of cybersecurity to post-secondary general
            education. Incorporating modern technology-related content into
            general education is not a new concept; the author previously worked
            for a Swedish university that was one of the first to mandate an
            information technology law course for all law students, and
            Caspersen [27] discussed the Danish and broader European movements
            to include informatics in general education for all education
            levels.

            Such a cybersecurity course could be designed in alignment with each
            educational institution’s own priorities for general education
            (e.g., emphasizing professional or liberal education competencies or
            both, encouraging appreciation for certain characteristics, etc.)
            while also fulfilling common, unmet needs in our workplaces. A
            recommended approach is to not start with content (firewalls, spam,
            etc.) but rather to design a curriculum based on general education
            goals that incorporate common needs for cybersecurity knowledge and
            behavior change in all workplaces. For example, learning objectives
            could include the ability to: • Construct real-world examples of the
            interconnected systems that we all work and live within and describe
            how threats, vulnerabilities, and opportunities may evolve. •
            Explain how individual, daily activities can impact the security
            posture of an organization or community.

            parallel with this paper’s call for a post-secondary general
            education course for improving workplace and societal cybersecurity.
            V. CONCLUSION Organizations in the public and private sectors face
            common challenges in their cybersecurity training and awareness
            activities for non-technical end users of their systems. The deeper
            goal is behavior change: fostering the skills and attitude shifts
            needed for the organization to achieve its desired cybersecurity
            posture and to maintain a cybersecure culture in which employees
            understand their roles and regularly monitor their everyday
            decisions and activities with due regard to their consequential
            impacts on organizational cybersecurity and cyber risk management.
            In the United States, post-secondary general education aims to
            instill certain characteristics in graduates across all majors;
            these competencies are based in both liberal education and
            professional preparations and typically have outcomes that blend
            benefits to the individual graduate with benefits to various
            communities and the democratic society.
